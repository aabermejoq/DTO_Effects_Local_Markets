This repo includes the scripts for cleaning, processing, and analyzing the data, plus the outputs used in the final study.  
The full national business registry for 2015 and 2019 is not included in this repository due to storage limitations. 
However, it is publicly available at INEGI: https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/descarga/default.html
